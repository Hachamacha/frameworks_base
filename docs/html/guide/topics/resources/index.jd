      <h4>New Tools For Managing Screen Sizes</h4>
      <p>Android 3.2 includes new tools for supporting devices with a wide range of screen sizes.
One important result is better support for a new size of screen; what is typically called a ?7-inch?
tablet. This release also offers several new APIs to simplify developers? work in adjusting to
different screen sizes.</p>

      <h4>Holo Everywhere</h4>
      <p>Before Android 4.0 the variance in system themes from device to device could make it
difficult to design an app with a single predictable look and feel. We set out to improve this
situation for the developer community in Ice Cream Sandwich and beyond.</p>

      <h4>New Mode for Apps on Large Screens</h4>
      <p>Android tablets are becoming more popular, and we're pleased to note that the vast majority
of apps resize to the larger screens just fine. To keep the few apps that don't resize well from
frustrating users with awkward-looking apps on their tablets, Android 3.2 introduces a screen
compatibility mode that makes these apps more usable on tablets.</p>

<p>You should always externalize resources such as images and strings from your application
code, so that you can maintain them independently. Externalizing your
resources also allows you to provide alternative resources that support specific device
configurations such as different languages or screen sizes, which becomes increasingly
important as more Android-powered devices become available with different configurations. In order
to provide compatibility with different configurations, you must organize resources in your
project's {@code res/} directory, using various sub-directories that group resources by type and
configuration.</p>

<p class="img-caption">
<strong>Figure 2.</strong> Two different devices, each using a different layout provided
for different screen sizes.</p>
</div>

<p>For any type of resource, you can specify <em>default</em> and multiple
<em>alternative</em> resources for your application:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Default resources are those that should be used regardless of
the device configuration or when there are no alternative resources that match the current
configuration.</li>
  <li>Alternative resources are those that you've designed for use with a specific
configuration. To specify that a group of resources are for a specific configuration,
append an appropriate configuration qualifier to the directory name.</li>
</ul>

<p>For example, while your default UI
layout is saved in the {@code res/layout/} directory, you might specify a different layout to
be used when the screen is in landscape orientation, by saving it in the {@code res/layout-land/}
directory. Android automatically applies the appropriate resources by matching the
device's current configuration to your resource directory names.</p>

<p>Figure 1 illustrates how the system applies the same layout for
two different devices when there are no alternative resources available. Figure 2 shows
the same application when it adds an alternative layout resource for larger screens.</p>

specify alternative resources, access them in your application, and more:</p>

<h2>Raw Assets</h2>

<p>An alternative to saving files in {@code res/} is to save files in the {@code
assets/} directory. This should only be necessary if you need direct access to original files and
directories by name. Files saved in the {@code assets/} directory will not be given a resource
ID, so you can't reference them through the {@code R} class or from XML resources. Instead, you can
query data in the {@code assets/} directory like an ordinary file system, search through the
directory and
read raw data using {@link android.content.res.AssetManager}. For example, this can be more useful
when dealing with textures for a game. However, if you only need to read raw data from a file
(such as a video or audio file), then you should save files into the {@code res/raw/} directory and
then read a stream of bytes using {@link android.content.res.Resources#openRawResource(int)}. This
is uncommon, but if you need direct access to original files in {@code assets/}, refer to the {@link
android.content.res.AssetManager} documentation.</p>
